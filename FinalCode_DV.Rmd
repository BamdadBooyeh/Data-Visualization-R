# Unveiling Socio-Economic Dynamics: Exploring Life Expectancy, Minimum Wage, and Key Variables Across Nations

## Introduction

In this section, we delve into the intricate relationship between life expectancy and minimum wage, along with other crucial variables such as unemployment rate, population, and GDP across various countries. The visualizations aim to unravel potential correlations and patterns.

## Life Expectancy Choropleth Map
We start by creating a choropleth map to visualize life expectancy across different countries for the year 2023. The map dynamically represents life expectancy values, allowing for an interactive exploration.
```{r}

color_limits <- c(50, 85) #based on min and max Life expectancy

# Create an interactive choropleth map
choropleth_map <- ggplot(merged_data, aes(fill = `Life expectancy`, group = name)) +
  geom_sf(color = "white", size = 0.2) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Life expectancy",
    labels = scales::comma,
    option = "viridis",
    limits = color_limits,
    breaks = c(50, 60, 70, 80, 85),
    direction = -1  
  ) +
  labs(title = "Choropleth Map of Life expectancy 2023 (Dynamic)")

# Convert ggplot to plotly
interactive_choropleth_map <- ggplotly(choropleth_map)
interactive_choropleth_map



```
## Minimum Wage Choropleth Map

A similar choropleth map is generated to illustrate the distribution of minimum wage values across countries in 2023.


```{r}


# Set the limits and breaks for the color scale
color_limits <- c(0, 14) 

color_breaks <- seq(0, 14, by = 2)  

# Create an interactive choropleth map for Minimum Wage
choropleth_map_minimum_wage <- ggplot(merged_data, aes(fill = `Minimum wage`, group = name)) +
  geom_sf(color = "white", size = 0.2) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Minimum wage",
    labels = scales::comma,
    option = "viridis",
    limits = color_limits,
    breaks = color_breaks,
    direction = -1
  ) +
  labs(title = "Choropleth Map of Minimum Wage 2023 (Dynamic)")

# Convert ggplot to plotly
interactive_choropleth_map_minimum_wage <- ggplotly(choropleth_map_minimum_wage)
interactive_choropleth_map_minimum_wage

```
## Box Plot: Minimum Wage and Life Expectancy Relationship

To delve deeper into the relationship between minimum wage and life expectancy, a box plot is constructed. The plot groups life expectancy into ranges and provides a visual representation of how minimum wage varies within each group

```{r,warning= F}


# Filter out rows with NA in 'Life Expectancy'
merged_data_no_na <- merged_data[!is.na(merged_data$`Life expectancy`),]

# Create the box plot
box_plot <- ggplot(merged_data_no_na, aes(x = cut(`Life expectancy`, breaks = 10), y = `Minimum wage`, fill = `Life expectancy`)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, color = "darkblue", size = 0.5, outlier.color = "red", outlier.shape = 16, outlier.size = 2) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Minimum Wage by Life Expectancy",
       x = "Life Expectancy (Grouped)",
       y = "Minimum Wage",
       fill = "Life Expectancy Group") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
        legend.position = "bottom")

# Convert ggplot to plotly
interactive_box_plot <- ggplotly(box_plot)

# Show the interactive box plot
interactive_box_plot




```

The box plot reveals potential trends and variations in minimum wage based on life expectancy groups. It sets the stage for a more detailed exploration of the connection between these two variables.


## Scatter Plot: Unemployment Rate's Role

To enrich the narrative, we extend our analysis by incorporating the unemployment rate. A scatter plot is employed to visualize the relationships between minimum wage, life expectancy, and unemployment rate.



```{r, warning=FALSE}


# Use ggplot2 to create a scatter plot
sc<-ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = `Life expectancy`, y = `Minimum wage`, color = `Unemployment rate`)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "plasma") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Minimum Wage vs. Life Expectancy",
       x = "Life Expectancy",
       y = "Minimum Wage",
       color = "Unemployment Rate")
# interactive it
wage_le <- ggplotly(sc)

wage_le
```
The scatter plot introduces the unemployment rate as a third variable. We observe how changes in minimum wage and life expectancy correlate with fluctuations in unemployment rate.


## Bubble Chart: Comprehensive Overview

Building on the previous visualizations, we present a 3D bubble chart that incorporates minimum wage, GDP, life expectancy, and population (Points Size). This chart aims to provide a comprehensive overview, considering multiple factors simultaneously.


```{r, collapse=TRUE,warning=FALSE}

# Create Bubble Chart
bubble_chart <- plot_ly(
  data = merged_data,
  x = ~`Minimum wage`,
  y = ~GDP,
  z = ~`Life expectancy`,
  size = ~Population,  
  text = ~name,
  color = ~continent,
  marker = list(
    opacity = 0.8,
    colorscale = 'Viridis',
    sizemode = "diameter"
  ),
  type = "scatter3d",
  mode = "markers"
) 

# Explicitly set color and legend group
for (cont in unique(merged_data$continent)) {
  subset_data <- merged_data[merged_data$Continent == cont, ]
  bubble_chart <- add_trace(bubble_chart,
                            data = subset_data,
                            x = ~`Minimum wage`,
                            y = ~GDP,
                            z = ~`Life expectancy`,
                            size = ~Population,
                            text = ~name,
                            color = ~continent,
                            colorscale = 'Viridis',
                            sizemode = "diameter",
                            type = "scatter3d",
                            mode = "markers",
                            legendgroup = cont)
}

# Set layout
bubble_chart <- layout(bubble_chart,
                       scene = list(
                         xaxis = list(title = "Minimum wage"),
                         yaxis = list(title = "GDP"),
                         zaxis = list(title = "Life Expectancy")
                       ))

# Show the chart
bubble_chart

```
## Conclusion 

Our visual analysis supports a positive correlation between minimum wage and life expectancy across countries. The box plot illustrates how minimum wage varies within distinct life expectancy groups. The scatter plot introduces unemployment rate, showing a positive correlation with both minimum wage and life expectancy.

The comprehensive bubble chart adds another layer, considering GDP and population. Through this lens, we identify clusters of countries, reinforcing the intricate connections between minimum wage, life expectancy, and broader economic factors.

This exploration suggests that policies enhancing minimum wage may contribute to improved living standards and positively impact life expectancy. However, recognizing the complexity and potential influence of external factors is crucial.




# Birth Rate and Its Influencing Factors

## Introduction

In this exploration, we aim to uncover the intricate connections between birth rates and crucial socio-economic factors. Through various visualizations, our goal is to reveal potential patterns and correlations, offering valuable insights into the dynamics that shape birth rates. Let's dive into the data and unravel the story it tells about the complex interplay of socio-economic elements influencing birth rates.


## KDE Plot of Birth Rate vs. Minimum Wage


```{r, collapse=TRUE}

# Select relevant columns and drop NA values
birth_wage <- merged_data %>%
  select(`Birth Rate`, `Minimum wage`) %>%
  drop_na()

# KDE plot with filled contours and no legend
kde_plot <- ggplot(birth_wage, aes(x = `Birth Rate`, y = `Minimum wage`)) +
  geom_density_2d_filled(color = "white", bins = 20) +
  labs(title = "KDE Plot of Birth Rate vs. Minimum Wage",
       x = "Birth Rate",
       y = "Minimum Wage") +
  theme_minimal() +
  guides(fill = FALSE)  # Remove legend

# Display the KDE plot
print(kde_plot)
```



```

The KDE plot vividly visualizes the negative correlation between these two variables. As we explore, we observe that higher minimum wages are associated with lower birth rates. Additionally, by examining the density contours, we can see not only the strength and direction of the correlation but also the concentration of data points, providing insights into the distribution of birth rates and minimum wages across the observed range.

## Hexbin Plot of Birth Rate vs. Education Enrollment


```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Filter out rows with missing values in the selected variables
correlogram_data <- merged_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Birth Rate`) & !is.na(`Gross tertiary education enrollment (%)`))

# Create a hexbin plot
hexbin_plot <- ggplot(correlogram_data, aes(x = `Birth Rate`, y = `Gross tertiary education enrollment (%)`)) +
  geom_hex(bins = 30) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Hexbin Plot of Birth Rate vs. Education Enrollment",
       x = "Birth Rate",
       y = "Gross tertiary education enrollment (%)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert the ggplot object to a plotly object
hexbin_plotly <- ggplotly(hexbin_plot)

# Display the interactive hexbin plot
hexbin_plotly


```
We shift our focus to the relationship between birth rate and gross tertiary education enrollment. The hexbin plot now comes into play, showcasing a negative correlation. Countries with higher education enrollment tend to exhibit lower birth rates.
 
## Scatter Plot with Regression Line: Tertiary Education Enrollment vs. Minimum Wage


To add another layer to our narrative, we investigate the positive correlation between tertiary education enrollment and minimum wage. The scatter plot, accompanied by a line of best fit, illustrates this relationship.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Scatter Plot with Line of Best Fit
# Scatter Plot with Line of Best Fit
scatter_fit_plot <- ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = `Gross tertiary education enrollment (%)`, y = `Minimum wage`)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 3) +  # Added transparency and adjusted point size for better visualization
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +  # Adjusted line aesthetics
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot with Regression Line: Tertiary Education Enrollment vs. Minimum Wage",
       x = "Tertiary Education Enrollment (%)",
       y = "Minimum Wage") +
  theme_minimal()  # Applied a minimal theme for clarity

# Show the scatter plot with line of best fit
scatter_fit_plot




```

## Word Cloud Analysis: Exploring the Impact of Tertiary Education Expansion on Fertility

To complement our investigation into the socio-economic factors influencing birth rates, we turn our attention to a qualitative analysis. The following code generates a word cloud based on a research document titled "Does tertiary education expansion affect the fertility of women past the college-entry age?".

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

tertiary_birth <- readLines("Downloads/tertiary_birth.rtf")

docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(tertiary_birth))
docs <- docs %>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation) %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace)
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
matrix <- as.matrix(dtm) 
words <- sort(rowSums(matrix),decreasing=TRUE) 
df <- data.frame(word = names(words),freq=words)

set.seed(100)
wordcloud(words = df$word, freq = df$freq, min.freq = 1, 
          max.words=100, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.1,
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))

```


This word cloud visually represents the most prominent terms in the research document, shedding light on the key topics and themes related to the impact of tertiary education expansion on the fertility of women beyond the college-entry age. By juxtaposing these qualitative insights with our quantitative analyses, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the multi-faceted dynamics influencing birth rates.


## Conclusion

Our exploration into birth rates and socio-economic factors unravels significant insights. The KDE plot suggests a negative correlation between birth rates and minimum wage, while the hexbin plot highlights a similar trend with gross tertiary education enrollment. The scatter plot reinforces a positive correlation between tertiary education enrollment and minimum wage.


The comprehensive analysis underscores the nuanced relationships between birth rates and socio-economic factors. As we navigate this intricate landscape, it becomes evident that understanding birth rates requires considering the synergies and tensions among various elements, from minimum wage and education enrollment to the qualitative insights extracted from research documents. These insights contribute to a more profound comprehension of the complex forces that shape demographic trends globally



# Exploring Temporal Trends: Birth, Death, and Life Expectancy Analysis

## Introduction
In this section, we delve into temporal trends related to birth rates, death rates, and life expectancy. The visualizations aim to capture the dynamics of these demographic indicators over time.

## Mean Life Expectancy Over Time


```{r}

# Melt the data frame for better plotting
melted_data_le <- time_le_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("YR"), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Life_Expectancy")

# Convert Year to numeric for proper sorting
melted_data_le$Year <- as.numeric(gsub("YR", "", melted_data_le$Year))

# Convert Life Expectancy to numeric
melted_data_le$Life_Expectancy <- as.numeric(as.character(melted_data_le$Life_Expectancy))

# Handle zero values by replacing them with NA
melted_data_le$Life_Expectancy[melted_data_le$Life_Expectancy == 0] <- NA

# Calculate mean life expectancy for each year
mean_le_data <- melted_data_le %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Life_Expectancy = mean(Life_Expectancy, na.rm = TRUE))

# Create an interactive time series plot for mean life expectancy
plot_le <- plot_ly(mean_le_data, x = ~Year, y = ~Mean_Life_Expectancy,
                   type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', line = list(width = 1))

# Customize layout
layout_le <- list(
  title = "Mean Life Expectancy Over Time",
  xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
  yaxis = list(title = "Mean Life Expectancy"),
  showlegend = FALSE
)

# Display the plot
fig_le <- plotly::layout(plot_le, layout_le)
fig_le


```
We start by examining the mean life expectancy over different years. 
The interactive time series plot visualizes how life expectancy has changed, revealing a substantial decrease in 2019. This intriguing observation prompts us to explore further.


## Birth and Death Rates Over Time

Motivated by the significant drop in life expectancy in 2019, we extend our exploration to birth and death rates. 


```{r}

# Melt the data frame for better plotting - Birth Rates
melted_data_birth <- time_birth_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("YR"), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Birth_Rate")

# Convert Year to numeric for proper sorting
melted_data_birth$Year <- as.numeric(gsub("YR", "", melted_data_birth$Year))

# Convert Birth Rate to numeric
melted_data_birth$Birth_Rate <- as.numeric(as.character(melted_data_birth$Birth_Rate))

# Calculate mean birth rate for each year
mean_birth_data <- melted_data_birth %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Birth_Rate = mean(Birth_Rate, na.rm = TRUE))


# Melt the data frame for better plotting - Death Rates
melted_data_death <- time_death_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("YR"), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Death_Rate")

# Convert Year to numeric for proper sorting
melted_data_death$Year <- as.numeric(gsub("YR", "", melted_data_death$Year))

# Convert Death Rate to numeric
melted_data_death$Death_Rate <- as.numeric(as.character(melted_data_death$Death_Rate))

# Calculate mean death rate for each year
mean_death_data <- melted_data_death %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Death_Rate = mean(Death_Rate, na.rm = TRUE))

# Merge the mean birth and death data
merged_data2 <- merge(mean_birth_data, mean_death_data, by = "Year", all = TRUE)

# Create an interactive plot
plot_rates <- plot_ly(merged_data2, x = ~Year) %>%
  add_lines(y = ~Mean_Birth_Rate, name = "Birth Rate", line = list(color = "blue", width = 1.2)) %>%
  add_lines(y = ~Mean_Death_Rate, name = "Death Rate", line = list(color = "red", width = 1.2)) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean Birth and Death Rates Over Time",
    xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean Rate"),
    showlegend = TRUE
  )

# Display the interactive plot
plot_rates

# Melt the data frame for better plotting - Life Expectancy
melted_data_le <- time_le_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("YR"), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Life_Expectancy")

# Convert Year to numeric for proper sorting
melted_data_le$Year <- as.numeric(gsub("YR", "", melted_data_le$Year))

# Convert Life Expectancy to numeric
melted_data_le$Life_Expectancy <- as.numeric(as.character(melted_data_le$Life_Expectancy))

# Calculate mean life expectancy for each year
mean_le_data <- melted_data_le %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Life_Expectancy = mean(Life_Expectancy, na.rm = TRUE))

# Merge the mean birth, death, and life expectancy data
merged_data3 <- merge(merged_data2, mean_le_data, by = "Year", all = TRUE)

# Create an interactive plot
plot_rates <- plot_ly(merged_data3, x = ~Year) %>%
  add_lines(y = ~Mean_Birth_Rate, name = "Birth Rate", line = list(color = "blue", width = 1.2)) %>%
  add_lines(y = ~Mean_Death_Rate, name = "Death Rate", line = list(color = "red", width = 1.2)) %>%
  add_lines(y = ~Mean_Life_Expectancy, name = "Life Expectancy", line = list(color = "green", width = 1.2)) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean Birth, Death, and Life Expectancy Over Time",
    xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean Rate/Expectancy"),
    showlegend = TRUE
  )

# Display the interactive plot
plot_rates
```

Our investigation unfolds a compelling narrative, marked by a consistent decline in birth rates since the turn of the millennium in 2000.

This extended decline prompts reflection on changing societal norms and evolving views towards family planning

Moreover, our exploration brings to light a noteworthy decrease in death rates, particularly evident post-2019.



## Conclusion

Our journey through time reveals interesting trends.
In 2019, there was a significant drop in average life expectancy. Looking closer at birth and death rates, we see a consistent decline in births since 2000 and a noticeable decrease in death rates after the 2019 pandemic.

These demographic changes suggest that external factors, like the COVID-19 pandemic, play a big role in how our population evolves. This exploration helps us understand demographic trends better and highlights the complex influences that shape our population over the years.




# Interesting Visuals: Discovering Fascinating Patterns

## Global Language Landscape: Top 15 Spoken Languages

### Description

In this part we explores the linguistic diversity across countries by visualizing the top 15 spoken languages based on their total population. 

The bar plot showcases the prevalence of each language, with the height of each bar representing the total population of countries where the language is spoken.

The numbers on top of the bars indicate the count of countries using each language, providing additional insights into the geographical distribution of linguistic communities. 

This visualization offers a snapshot of the global linguistic landscape and highlights the prominence of specific languages in terms of both population and country count.

```{r, collapse=TRUE}

# Filter out rows where Official language is 'None'
world_data_2023_filtered <- subset(world_data_2023, `Official language` != 'None')

# Sum the population for each language
language_populations <- aggregate(Population ~ `Official language`, data = world_data_2023_filtered, sum)

# Sort the dataset by the total population for each language
language_populations <- language_populations[order(language_populations$Population, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Select the top 15 languages
top_languages <- head(language_populations, 15)

# Count the number of countries for each language
country_counts <- aggregate(Country ~ `Official language`, data = world_data_2023_filtered, function(x) length(unique(x)))

# Merge top_languages with country_counts
top_languages_with_counts <- merge(top_languages, country_counts, by = "Official language")

## Exploring Country Frequencies by Continent

### Description
This code generates an interactive donut plot displaying country frequencies by continent. The dynamic visualization not only offers insights into the distribution of countries across different continents but also allows for a more detailed exploration. By clicking on any continent, you can access information on the specific number of countries included, adding an interactive element to enhance your exploration of the dataset.
```{r}

# Create a table of frequencies
frequency_table <- table(merged_data$continent)

# Convert the table to a data frame
frequency_df <- as.data.frame(frequency_table)
frequency_df$continent <- rownames(frequency_df)

# Create an interactive donut plot 
plot_ly(
  data = frequency_df,
  labels = ~Var1,
  values = ~Freq,
  type = 'pie',
  hole = 0.4,  # Set hole size for the donut effect
  textinfo = 'percent+label',
  marker = list(
    colors = scales::viridis_pal()(length(frequency_df$continent)),
    line = list(color = 'white', width = 2)
  )
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Country Frequencies by Continent(Dynamic)",
    annotations = list(
      text = paste("Total: ", sum(frequency_df$Freq)),
      x = 0.5,
      y = 0.5,
      font = list(size = 15)
    ),

## Radar Chart - Multivariate Comparison by Continent

### Description
The radar chart compares average values of key socio-economic indicators (unemployment rate, physicians per thousand, minimum wage, and fertility rate) across continents. It provides a visual summary of the diverse socio-economic landscapes, highlighting variations and trends among continents.



``` {r, collapse=TRUE}

# Specify custom order for continent levels
continent_order <- c("Asia", "Europe", "Africa", "North America", "South America", "Oceania")

# Filter and aggregate data


# Calculate the mean values for each variable by continent
radar_data <- aggregate(cbind(`Unemployment rate`, 
                               `Physicians per thousand`, 
                               `Minimum wage`,
                               `Fertility Rate`) ~ continent,
                        data = merged_data, 
                        mean, 
                        na.rm = TRUE)

# Reorder the levels of the continent variable
radar_data$continent <- factor(radar_data$continent, levels = continent_order)

# Create a radar chart
ggradar(radar_data,
        grid.min = 0, 
        grid.max =5, 
        grid.mid = 2.5,
        values.radar = c("0", "2.5", "5"), # the labels of the grid
        group.point.size = 0.05,
        group.line.width = 2,
        plot.extent.x.sf = 0.9,
        plot.extent.y.sf = 1.5) +
  ggtitle("Multivariate Comparison by Continent (Average)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  # Adjust legend position

```

### Conclusion

By looking through our radar chart we can see that, Oceania takes the spotlight, flaunting the highest minimum wage and unemployment rate, intertwining with our earlier findings on their positive correlation. 

Europe steps onto the stage, boasting the highest number of physicians per thousand and, surprisingly, the least fertility rate. 

Africa, standing out with the highest fertility rate, presents a unique contrast by showcasing the least rates in other variables. This unexpected twist deepens our understanding of global socio-economic dynamics.

The remaining continents contribute to the intricate mosaic, revealing similarities in the analyzed indicators.

Our exploration unfolds, weaving a captivating narrative of diversity and interconnections across the globe.
